        <p>Ahh Waffle House. No harbinger of bad news can be found amongst it's brown tiles and yellow lights. Art has long been neglected in exchange for sticky syrup bottles and unhinged employees. Occupied nightly by a woman named Crystal who's missing all but one tooth, but is satisfied to serve customers the crispiest bacon and hash browns just to see the deep sense of righteousness on your face when you bite into it. Crystal can't eat crispy bacon, but she can work at waffle house and make the world a little bit better. No man shall ever be turned down the most consistently acceptable diner food nor shall any man be shamed for falling in the door way of the rectangular cathedral at 2:45 in the morning. A place for heavy minds and weak bodies alike, for food that invigorates the soul and vanquishes all suffering. The place you can find anyone sitting by themselves, needing no excuses to alone. With the promise of burned bacon on the way, Toby Keith on the juke box, and a vanilla coke on the table, all anxiety relinquishes itself to freedom and an understanding that in this moment, in this place, all is good. And every other diner, can be forgotten.</p>
